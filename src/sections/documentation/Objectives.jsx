          The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a
          web-based Khmer Sign Language Translation System that can recognize
          hand gestures and translate them into readable text and spoken output
          in real time. The system aims to serve as both a learning tool and a
          communication aid by combining computer vision and machine learning
          technologies in an accessible web application.

          This project also focuses on improving the understanding of artificial
          intelligence implementation in real-world scenarios. By working with
          datasets, pre-trained models, and system integration, the team gains
          hands-on experience in building practical machine learning
          applications that go beyond theory.
